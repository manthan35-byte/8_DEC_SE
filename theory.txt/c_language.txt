** SDLC Methodology [Software Development life cycle] **
    "
        The SDLC referec to a Methodology with clearly defined processes for creating high-quality software in detail.
        the SDLC Methodology focues on the following phases of Software Devlopment 
    "
    1. Requirement Gathering
    2. Analysis
    3. Designing
    4. Implementation
    5. Testing
    6. Maintenance

** Client & Server **

[1] Client Program 
    -> Running on end Host
    -> Request Server 
        e.g. Web browser

[2] Server Program
    -> Running on end host
    -> Provides Services
     e.g. Webserver

 // Client - Server Communication //

    [1] Client  - Sometimes on

    -> Intilates a Request to the server when intersted.
      e.g Web Browser on your laptop & cell phone
    -> Dosen't Communication directly with other clients.
    -> needs to know the servers address.

    [2] Server - Always on 

    -> Service requests from many host
    ->  e.g. web server for the WWW.demo.com web site.
    -> doesn't initiate contract with the clients.
    -> needs a fixeed well know address.

** HTTP :- Hyper Text transfer Protocol.
        -> Which is mainly work as a waiter or delivery boy.
        -> Which take request from client and send request to server.
        -> reciver response from server and return back to client.

   HTTPS :- Hyper Text transfer Protocol Secure.
        -> Protocol :- in simple language we can say rule.
    
** Http Or https **

    // Accepts // 

        url
        methods
        header
        body (Post - put) (registration - update)

    // Response  from Server//

        status code 
        header
        body (content)
 
** WWW - "World Wide Web" **
    -> know as a web
    -> it is a collection of website or web pages stored in web servers.
    -> connected to local computers throught the internal.
    -> these website contain text pages, digital images, audio, videos, etc.
    -> users can access the content of these site from any part of the world over the intement using their devices such as computer, laptop,phone, etc.
    -> the www , along with internet enables the retrival and display of text & media to your device.

** Type of Application Softwere ** 

    -> Application Software -> Web / Mobile
    -> System Software
    -> Driver Software
    -> middleware Software
    -> Programimg Software

VERSION CONTROL SYSTEM : (VCS)

    version CONTROL system mainly track user's record 
    which can track all changes and we can go back to previous changes using of vcs 

here we have one version control tool : git 

git : open source version control software or tool 

github : github is a version control hosting platform using of git we can push / pull 
        data or records on github platform. 

-----------------------------------------------
steps to configure cli git - github 
----------------------------------------------------
(Apply below steps only 1st time at installation)
    step 1 : install git 

    step 2 : open git bash  (windows only)

    step 3 : to check git's version 
        #git --version 

    step 4 : conifgure your github account with git 

            in git bash perform below commands 

            #git config --global user.name "username"
            #git config --global user.email "emailaddress" 

    step 5 : to check your configuration is done or not 

            #git config --list   (you can check your name and email in that list )

----------------------------------------------------
==> Now, add any new repo on github 

for the first time when you want to create "new repo" perform below commands 

step 1 : login your github account in browser 
            |
            V 
        go in repository 
            |
            V 
        right side there is one button "new"
            |
            V 

        create your repository "any name here"  -> click on create repository 

step 2 : create same name folder in your system (local system)

step 3 : open that new folder in your visual studio code 

step 4 : peform below command to configure your local repo with cloud repository 

        #git init 
        
        #git branch -M main    (to set your main branch)

        #git remote add origin  "url from github repository" 

step 5 : add and push your content (every time when you apply changes)

        e.g.  create one file in your folder 

        #git add . 

        #git commit -m "message"

        #git push -u origin main

 what is language?

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 language is a way of communicate 

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 compiler : which is used to compile whole source file and gives output after completion of source file .

 interpreret : it execute line by line 

 line by line it send code to machine - and machine convert into human code and resend to user.

 interpreter is slower then compiler
 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

what is meaning of program ?

program is a collection of lnstructoin code . 

---------------------------------------------

what is meaning of programing language ?

a language which is used to write a program .

---------------------------------------------------

example of programing language ?

c,c++,java,python,php,.net c#(c-sharp) ...

------------------------------------------------

what is c programin language ?

c is most powerfull,popular compiler type language.
c is easy to understand.
c language was inveted by denis m. ritchie in at and a bell lab.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

history of c programing : 

before c programin there is bcpl and b language and then c programing

c language is batter version of b language .

actully bcpl and b language working upon assembly language so, it difficult to understand so,denis m ritchie invented c programing in 1972.

in 1989 ansi standerized of  c programing .

ansi : american national standerd insitute.

after standarized ofn c programing its known as a ansi c,c89.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

features of c programing language : 

c language is a easy to understand programing language-mother of all language.

c contains laiberies

----------------------------------------------------------------

real world uses of c 

operating system 
games 
kernals
driver 
embedded system

-----------------------------------------------------------------

structure of program 
1) documantation of program :
 which represent yourr program's title or description 
 which represent by comments

 compiler skip or ignore comments :

there are 2 type of comment :

1)single line; which is represent //

e.g.  
 
    // this is single line comment //
2) multi line : which represent by /*    */

e.g.

       /* this is 
                 multiline 
                          comment 

                          */

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

2)connection with c language libary 

#include<stdio.h>
#include<conio.h>

here,  # : which is predefined 

include : to add something

<stdio.h> : standerd input output header file 

     using of this header file we can access inbuilt function from this file 

   <conio.h> : console input output header file.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3)executation of program 

void main ()
{

}

   //here void is a data type which does not return value 

            /*here,main is a functoin which is represent that this a main executable of function 

{

}
        this is represent block of code.
       */

--------------------------------19/12/2025------------------------------------------------
printf() :

   in c language  printf is a function which is used to
   display message on output(console screen)
syntax : 

printf("message");

; semocolon which is undicate end of the line 

it is used to terminate statement
 
by defualt printf function join with previous function 
-----------------------------------------------------------
escape sequence :
 
\n :new line 
\t :tab
\' :to dispaly single quote
\" :to dispaly single  duoble quote
\\ :to display slash 
 
 -----------------------------------------------------------

datatype : which type of value store in a variable its calles datatype.

1) numbers : 

without point- int (integer) (%d)
e.g. 15

with point-float (%f),double (%lf),long double (%LF)
e.g. 150.50

2) character : 

single char-char (%C)

string-"hello"char[size](%s)

3) yes/no : 

bool (boolean)-true/false 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

variable : 

in c language we can take any name as a variable 

but there are some f=rule we must follow 

variable devided in 3 part :

1)varible declaration :

before use with variable we must have to declare with datatype.

syntax: <datatype> variablename;

2)variable initlization:

assign a value 
syntax:variablename = value;

3)variable calling or variable use 

syntax:printf(variablename)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
token : in c token is a piece of code or we can say that identity of code.

1) keywords : keywords are reserved words which is writtern is small letters 

keywords mainly define by system which we can use for specific purpose

there are 32 keywords in c language.

note:in c we can't take keywords as a variable name.

e.g. int int=10 " x 

bcs,here int is keyword

2) identifiers:identifiers which means anything which is identify something

like variable,function,arrays or anything

so,in simple language we can say that identifier identify something in program

3)constant:constant means fix value 

which does not change in program \

at programing time we want to fix some value

e.g. const float pi =3.14; fix value

4)opearators:a specific symbol which is represent to perform some operations 

like , + _ * and many more 

5) specialy charater : , ; [] () all these are speciall character 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

variable rules : 

1)variable name can be contain a to z or A to Z or 0 - 9

2)variable name cannot start with digit 

3)variable name cannot contain whitespace

int num 1; x 

4)we can't use any special characters in variable name

5)any reserve word or a keyword we can't take as a variable name .

e.g. int int; x 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
printf(): to print value on output screen 

scanf():n which i=mainly use for accept value at run time 

or simple language we can say that scanf use to read value.

syntax: scanf(placeholder,variable);

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

accept float value from user 

syntax:

scanf("%f"&var);

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

operators: there is some specific symbol which is mainly used to perform operations 

e.g. num1+num2;\

here,num1 and num2 operands

1)arithmatic operators :

to perform arithmatic opearations 

+ _ * / %

2)assignment operator :

=

to assign a value 

shorthand opearator 
    combination of arithmatic and assignment opearator
    += -= *= /= %=
    
  3)relational operator :
< > <= >= == !=
4)logical opearator :
&& [and operator]

||   [or operator]

!  [not operator]

5)unity operator :

this opearator divided in 2 part 

postfix
prefix 

++[increment]
--[decrement]

6)bitwise operator :

xor
not
or 
left shift 
right shift 

7)conditional operator :

exp1 ? exp2 ? : exp3 ?;

?;
==================================================================
conditional statement:
there are 3 types of conditional statements.

1)conditional statement

2)looping statement

3)jumping statement

---------------------------------------------------------
1)conditional statement:which is based condition wise 

there are 5 types:
1)if statement
2)if..else statement
3)else if statement
4)nested if statement
5)switch statement

---------------------------------------------------------
1)if statement:if condition goes true it will execute 

syntax:(condition)
{

}
---------------------------------------------------------
2)if..else statement:
if part execute when condition goes true and
else part execute when conditiongoes false.

syntax:
if(condition)
{
    true statement;
}
else
{
    false statement;
}
--------------------------------------------------------------------
3)else if statement:
//find even and odd number
